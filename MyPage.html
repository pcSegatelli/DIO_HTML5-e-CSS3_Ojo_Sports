                    Fencing is the sport of sword fighting. In fencing, two opponents compete on an elevated piste. The piste is sometimes referred to as the strip or playing area. The piste is 14 metres long and 1.5 metres wide. Falling to the side results in a 1-metre retreat. Falling off at the end results in a point for your opponent. A scored encounter between <a href="mailto:ojoSchool@gmail.com">fencers</a> is called a bout. A bout comprises of three, three-minute rounds. In a bout, the goal is to score a valid touch on your opponent. Each touch counts as a point. The first fencer to 15 points wins. There are three <a href="https://fie.org/new-to-fencing/weapons" target ="_blank">weapons</a> used in fencing: épée, foil, or saber. Each weapon has its own characteristics, rules, and signature style.
